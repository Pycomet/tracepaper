# browser_extension/Dockerfile.test

# Use a Node.js base image that includes utilities for installing Chrome
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.40.0-jammy

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app/browser_extension

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if it exists)
COPY package.json ./
# COPY package-lock.json ./

# Install npm dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the browser extension code
COPY . .

# Puppeteer needs these dependencies, Playwright base image should have them.
# If using a different base image, you might need:
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
#     chromium \
#     # Add any other dependencies required by Puppeteer/Chrome
#     --no-install-recommends \
#  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH to the installed Chrome/Chromium if necessary
# ENV PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium

# Command to run the tests
CMD ["npm", "test"]
